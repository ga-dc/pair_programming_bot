# The Pair Programming Bot

[Link to deployed app](pairprogrammingbot.herokuapp.com)

## Learning Objectives:

 - Write routes to handle specific requests
 - Render a view template with data derived from the URL (params)
 - Passing data to ERB (Embedded Ruby templates) via instance variables

## Prompt

You are going to recreate the Pair Programming Bot from scratch using Sinatra. The pair programming 'bot' render a page where it asks the programmer a question relating to the development of his or her code. Each page will either have a 'YES/NO' option or a 'DONE' option, and each option will link to the appropriate page.

### Helpful Hints from a Benevolent Alum

- Draw a flow chart for the app's behavior before you code a word. Check out [this flowchart example](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8160/7214525854_733237dd83_z.jpg) for flowchart inspiration.

- You should use ERB templates to keep your code DRY. Ask yourself what types of pages you will need a template for?

- For each of the templates that you use, think about what information you will need to pass in using instance variables.

- Styling is secondary, so don't start styling until your app works.
